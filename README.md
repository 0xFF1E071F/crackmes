# Some Crackmes

These are some crackmes. I wrote them to familiarize myself with reverse engineering. 

To work with them, run `make <name>` where `<name>` is one of `crackme01`, `crackme02`, 
etc. This will produce 2 binaries, one for 32 bits code and one for 64 bits code. Figure
out how to make the crackme exit with the status code 0.

Don't ruin it for yourself by reading the source code! Enjoy.
