# Some Crackmes

I wrote a [tutorial](https://leotindall.com/tutorial/an-intro-to-x86_64-reverse-engineering/) about these crackmes.

These are some crackmes. I wrote them to familiarize myself with reverse engineering. 

To work with them, run `make <name>` where `<name>` is one of `crackme01`, `crackme02`, etc. Figure out how to make the crackme exit with the status code 0.

Don't ruin it for yourself by reading the source code! Enjoy.
