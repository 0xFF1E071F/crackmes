# Some Crackmes

These are some crackmes. I wrote them to familiarize myself with reverse engineering. To work with them:

    1. Have a Unix system or something like it (WSL, Cygwin).
    1. Have a debugger. I like Hopper's free demo.
    1. Run `make <name>` where `<name>` is one of `crackme01`, `crackme02`, etc.
    1. Figure out how to make the crackme exit with the status code 0.

Don't ruin it for yourself by reading the source code! Enjoy.
